# Bell QMC
This is an open-source code for simulating 1D transverse-field Ising model using Bell-QMC.

Bell-QMC is a novel Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) framework leveraging Bell sampling from quantum information science, a two-copy measurement protocol in the transversal Bell basis. It is a powerful framework that significantly expands the accessible quantum properties in conventional QMC simulations, providing an exponential advantage over conventional QMC.
